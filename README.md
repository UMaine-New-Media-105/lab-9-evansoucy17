Fly Simulation- https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/KZQ2jAiOc

For this code I created a sprite that moves along the x and y axis randomly and bounces off the walls. I started byt creating a line of code that has a simple ball bouncing off the x and y axis. I then modified the code to include a fly instead off a ball. I then introduced classes to my line of code. I then added in more flies so 50 flies filled up the screen. I had a slight issue when adding my sprite becuase it wasn't in the top left corner so I had to modify the code until it bounced off the walls and didn't go over the edge of the canvas.
